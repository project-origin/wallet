# Wallets and Wallet Sections

A wallet is a fundamental component within the system that enables users to store and manage their ownership of digital assets, specifically Granular Certificates (GCs) and their corresponding slices. It serves as a centralized repository for users to access, view, and control their assets across multiple registries, issuers, and countries.

## Wallets

A wallet is uniquely identified by a WalletId and is associated with a specific owner. The owner's identity is represented by the Owner field. The wallet also holds the private key of the wallet.
The private key is used for cryptographic operations related to ownership verification and transaction signing.

All calls to the system are done with a JWT (Json Web Token) and enables the system to identify the current user.

## Wallet Sections

Wallet sections are utilized within the system to enable secure asset transfers and ownership management.
Each wallet section is uniquely identified by a SectionId and is associated with a specific wallet through a foreign key reference (WalletId) and a WalletPosition.

### Purpose of Wallet Sections

The registries use public-private key-pairs to represent the ownership of GCs. The public key is used to verify the ownership of a slice, while the private key is used to sign transactions.
To ensure privacy and security each slice must be associated with a unique public key.

To enable the transfer of slices without having to query the wallet before each insert to get unique public keys, the wallet is divided into sections that use hierarchical deterministic keys (HD Keys) to generate unique public keys for each slice.

This way a public-key for a section can be shared to other parties, and they can generate unique public keys for each slice within that section without having to query the wallet.

The owner of the wallet can generate the corresponding private keys for each slice within the section using their private key stored in their wallet.
This approach provides a level of privacy and control as the other party only knows the public key of the section.

## Hierarchical Deterministic Keys (HD Keys)

Wallets and sections employ Hierarchical Deterministic Keys (HD Keys) to ensure the uniqueness and security of keys used for each slice.
HD Keys allow for the generation of a sequence of public keys from a single master private key. With HD Keys, each wallet section has a unique public key derived from the corresponding private key. This enables secure ownership verification of the slices within that section.

Wallet sections, combined with the use of HD Keys, provide users with a secure and convenient way to manage their ownership of GCs within the system. By sharing the public key of a specific section, owners can receive assets into that section while maintaining control over their private key. This allows for seamless asset transfers and ownership management across different registries and issuers.

## Abstraction

The wallet and wallet sections abstract the underlying infrastructure and architecture, providing users with a unified interface to interact with their digital assets. Users can query their certificates, transfer ownership, and perform other operations without the need to understand the intricate details of the system's internals.

The wallet and wallet sections play a crucial role in enabling users to have a comprehensive view of their digital assets, regardless of the number of registries, issuers, or countries involved. They provide a secure and user-centric approach to asset management within the system.
