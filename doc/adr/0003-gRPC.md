# Use of gRPC over REST

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our wallet needs to communicate with other services that could be written in different programming languages, including C# and Go.
The communication between these services must be fast, efficient, and reliable.

We have considered using REST as the communication protocol between these services.
However, we are concerned about the performance and scalability issues that may arise with REST, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

## Decision

After careful consideration, we chosen to use gRPC as the communication protocol for the wallet.
gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework that provides efficient and reliable communication between services.

Specifically, we propose using the following approach:

- gRPC will be used to define a common schema and interface for communication using the Protobuf format. This will ensure that all services use the same data structures and reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

- gRPC will be used to handle both unary and streaming calls. This will enable us to efficiently handle both small and large volumes of data.

By using gRPC over REST, we will be able to ensure fast, efficient, and reliable communication between our microservices.

## Consequences

The decision to use gRPC over REST will have the following consequences:

- The use of a common schema and interface will ensure consistency between services and reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies.

- The use of gRPC will improve the performance and scalability of the system, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

- The use of gRPC may require additional infrastructure, such as a load balancer or service discovery tool, which will add to the complexity and cost of the system.

- gRPC is less well known by the developers, which may take some time and effort to learn.

Overall, we believe that using gRPC over REST is a good choice for our wallet project, given its need for fast, efficient, and reliable communication between multiple microservices written in different programming languages.
