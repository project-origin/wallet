# Use of CQRS with Async Commands

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our wallet needs to handle a high volume of transactions from multiple sources, including mobile devices, web applications, and APIs.
The wallet will interact with distributed registries, other wallets and a local datastore.

The registries and other wallets uses async gRPC calls.

## Decision

After careful consideration, we propose using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to handle transactions in our wallet project. The CQRS pattern separates commands (write operations) from queries (read operations) and uses different models to handle each.

Specifically, we propose using the following approach:

- Commands will be handled asynchronously using an event-driven architecture, where a command is sent to a message broker and then processed by a command handler. This will allow us to handle a high volume of transactions and ensure the responsiveness of the system.

- Queries will be handled synchronously using a traditional CRUD approach, where a query is sent to a database and then processed by a query handler. This will allow us to provide fast and consistent data access to the users.

By separating commands from queries allows the wallet to implement different models to handle each.

In the **first version** of the wallet it will be implemented by a **simple shared classic relational database**.
This is to ensure fast development and not over complicate parts of the system before it is needed,
but by separating Commands from queries from the start enables later seperation and optimizations.

## Consequences

The decision to use CQRS with async commands will have the following consequences:

- The implementation of CQRS with async commands will add complexity to the codebase and require additional time for development and testing.

- The system will become more scalable and performant, allowing us to handle a higher volume of transactions and improve the responsiveness of the system.

- The separation of commands and queries will allow us to optimize the system for each type of operation, improving the efficiency of the system.

- The use of an event-driven architecture may require additional infrastructure, such as a message broker, which will add to the complexity and cost of the system.

- Implementing a simple first version with a simple relational database, will simplify the codebase and speed up development.

Overall, we believe that using CQRS with async commands is a good choice for our wallet project, given its distributed registries.
